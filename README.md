**OSRL (Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning)** offers a collection of elegant and extensible implementations of state-of-the-art offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Aimed at propelling research in offline safe RL, OSRL serves as a solid foundation to implement, benchmark, and iterate on safe RL solutions.

The OSRL package is a crucial component of our larger benchmarking suite for offline safe learning, which also includes [DSRL](https://github.com/liuzuxin/DSRL) and [FSRL](https://github.com/liuzuxin/FSRL), and is built to facilitate the development of robust and reliable offline safe RL solutions.

To learn more, please visit our [project website](http://www.offline-saferl.org).

## Installation

OSRL is currently hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/osrl-lib), you can simply install it by:

```bash
pip install osrl-lib
```

You can also pull the repo and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liuzuxin/OSRL.git
cd osrl
pip install -e .
```

If you want to use the `CDT` algorithm, please also manually install the `OApackage`:
```bash
pip install OApackage==2.7.6
```

## How to use OSRL

The example usage are in the `examples` folder, where you can find the training and evaluation scripts for all the algorithms. 
All the parameters and their default configs for each algorithm are available in the `examples/configs` folder. 
OSRL uses the `WandbLogger` in [FSRL](https://github.com/liuzuxin/FSRL) and [Pyrallis](https://github.com/eladrich/pyrallis) configuration system. The offline dataset and offline environments are provided in [DSRL](https://github.com/liuzuxin/DSRL), so make sure you install both of them first.

### Training
For example, to train the `bcql` method, simply run by overriding the default parameters:

```shell
python examples/train/train_bcql.py --task OfflineCarCirvle-v0 --param1 args1 ...
```
By default, the config file and the logs during training will be written to `logs\` folder and the training plots can be viewed online using Wandb.

You can also launch a sequence of experiments or in parallel via the [EasyRunner](https://github.com/liuzuxin/easy-runner) package, see `examples/train_all_tasks.py` for details.

### Evaluation
To evaluate a trained agent, for example, a BCQ agent, simply run
```
python example/eval/eval_bcql.py --path path_to_model --eval_episodes 20
```
It will load config file from `path_to_model/config.yaml` and model file from `path_to_model/checkpoints/model.pt`, run 20 episodes, and print the average normalized reward and cost.
